- Create a video script from the following lecture to be processed by an ai tool into a video
- recreate the script with focus on winning customers, students, business partners, a scholarship, keeping it smart but easy to understand and integrating software engineering practices and the learnings of IT and Business studies. Make it seem like it is done by an experienced Professor and salesman, who is a very fair partner but also knows his worth. Focus also on winning Affiliate Partners and show possibilities taking the collaboration further, e.g. to drop shipping, creating a startup or opening the horizon in other ways. 
- recreate you lecuture YouTube video tutorial script. To do so combine the inputs but use a more professional yet easy to understand language. Showcase the experience and background in computer science, but use good communication skills to talk with business men and formulate it like you would present it to a professional and beautiful woman. Utilise Software engineering techniques and best practices and make it neat.
