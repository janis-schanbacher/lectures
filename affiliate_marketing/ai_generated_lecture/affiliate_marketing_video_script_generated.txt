[Whiteboard Diagram: Definitions]

AI powered Janis: First and foremost, we'll define our domain. Affiliate marketing, a performance-based strategy, where affiliates, individuals, or businesses, champion the products or services of other companies, the merchants. They earn commissions based on real results.

AI powered Janis: It's all about forging partnerships, much like a software engineer collaborating with a brilliant businesswoman. Affiliates promote the merchant's products, and in return, they're rewarded for every successful sale or lead they generate.

AI powered Janis: The goal here? A win-win scenario where both the affiliate and the merchant benefit from increased sales and exposure.

AI powered Janis: Then there are our champions, the affiliates. Be they individuals or businesses, they embark on the quest to promote the merchant's offerings and secure their commission based on their valiant marketing endeavors.

AI powered Janis: And finally, the customers, the end beneficiaries. They acquire the products and take the desired actions, all thanks to the strategic marketing efforts of the affiliates.
